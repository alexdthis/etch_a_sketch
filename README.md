# etch_a_sketch

This is a webpage that will simulate a sketchpad/etch-a-sketch. This will be a demonstration of javascript, html, and css styles
that I have learned so far.

In this project, I will be creating a page that creates a square of 16x16 divs (soon to be any number of divs in the future).
I hope to implement a button that brings up prompt to allow for a variable number of divs. Once they are drawn on the screen,
the color of the grid should change from white to black (to any variable color in the future) when you hover over them (hoping to
change that when the mouse is pressed in the future).
